              Have you ever been on a run listening to some sick beats killing your previous best when out of nowhere Josh
              Groben
              comes on and kills your vibe!? Today sharks we present to you Tempo!
            </p>
            <p>
              Tempo allows people to stack their playlists according to the pace they want to keep using complex
              algorithms that
              calculate a personâ€™s stride per minute to reach a desired mile time and match that to a list of songs with
              the
              optimum tempo for each individual.
